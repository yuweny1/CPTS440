Router-R3 version 0.9.0
======================

    This mod is a XS wrapper around a C library R3.

    R3 is an URL router library with high performance, thus, it's implemented in C. It compiles your route paths into a prefix trie.

    By using the constructed prefix trie in the start-up time, you can dispatch routes with efficiency.
